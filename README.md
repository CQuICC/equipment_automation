  - Captures the waveform from Rohde & Schwarz RTM3004 oscilloscope and plots it on a PC. The data points are also written in a text file for post procesing (if necessary).
  - Changes to FFT mode, and collected the magnitude on the spectrum for a set frequency using cursor. 
* PSD7303B: Controls the programmable DC power supply. 
* MPC320: Control the paddle position of the motorised molarisation controller from Thorlabs.
* ELL20/M: Thorlabs Linear Stage. Travel Distance 60mm. 
* NRT-8000: An optical spectrum analyser from New Ridge Technologies.
